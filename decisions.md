# Decisions

- 2026-10-11: Use frozen pretrained Qwen2.5-0.5B. Native pretraining and collaborative
  generation are outside phase one per user clarification.
- 2026-10-11: Compare the same four-token block decoder across J-lens readout,
  individual residual/attention layers and a configurable selected-layer set.
- 2026-10-11: Independent private repository, direct main commits, regular pushes,
  uv dependency management, and an AGENTS.md documentation workflow adapted from
  Age of Agents, as requested by the user.
